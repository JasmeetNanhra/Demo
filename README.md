we can save these changes through the GIT 'status' command that shows all the files are created or edited but are not saved yet.
we can create new files and when we put 'git status', files will show under untracked as git does not recognize them. to add all the modified files and untracked files, just simply put 'git add .' or 'git add fileName.ext'
